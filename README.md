# The-scientific-function-of-the-Pyramids-at-Giza
The Illuminati was originally termed when ancient Egyptians discovered energy and were able to store energy in "Baghdad batteries" and build rudimentary heating elements, glass bulbs, etc. The French saw this from the Mediterranean and Sacked Egypt as described in Exodus. Thus when a Saxon nation invades a foreign territory, it is called a "sacking" a nation.  The Pharaoh Nesu bity NebkheperuRa Sa Ra Tutankhamun was an engineer like his father Ra. The pyramids were a design which worked as a reactor with alkaline solutions at the base of the pyramid and a conductor which drew energy from a conductive cap piece made of Gold or Silver. The Alkaline solutions were used to capture induced charge from the atmosphere through a series of tunnels. The batteries were charged for hot plates, heating, etc. Charge available from Pyramid structures was capable of creating arcs and light from filament.  When France invaded Egypt, King Tut Fled as a young boy. Tutankhamun returned as a man called Moses.  "In the fourth year of the reign of Tutankhamun, sovereign of Mitsrayim, the children of Yisrael were besieged. Tutankhamun was forced into exile and a new "Pharaoh" arose over Mitsrayim who did not know Yoseph." -Exodus 1:9  "Tutankhamun heard of the deaths of the sons of Yisrael and the adulterous slavery of the daughters of Mitsrayim, Tutankhamun returned from the Sea as a new leader and hero of his people. #ILLUMINATI
